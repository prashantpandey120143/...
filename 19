The 3pillars of digital security are:
• Confidentiality
• Integrity
• Availability

Cyberspace typically involves a large computer network made up of 
many worldwide computer sub networks that employ TCP / IP 
protocol to aid in communication and data exchange activities.

Security Issues /Breaches in Cyberspace:
 Unauthorized access– It is accessing computer, computer, network, system or
device without permission from those who are authorized to access the same.
• Distributed Denial of Service Attack
• Adistributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is when an attacker, or
attackers, attempt to make it impossible for a service to be delivered.
• This can be achieved by thwarting access to virtually anything: servers,
devices, services, networks, applications, and even specific transactions
within applications.
• It’s one system that is sending the malicious data or requests; a DDoS
attack comes from multiple systems.
• Malware, or malicious software, is any program or file that is harmful 
to a computer user.
Types of malware can include computer viruses, worms, Trojan 
horses and spyware.
• Social engineering attacks
• It involves some form of psychological manipulation, fooling 
otherwise unsuspecting users or employees into handing over 
confidential or sensitive data.
• Commonly, social engineering involves email or other 
communication that invokes urgency, fear, or similar emotions in the
victim.
• Phishing
• Phishing attacks attempt to gain sensitive, confidential information 
such as usernames, passwords, credit card information, network 
credentials, and more.
• Crypto Jacking
• It is a type of cybercrime that involves the unauthorized use 
of people's devices (computers, smartphones, tablets, or even 
servers) by cybercriminals to mine for crypto currency.
• Crypto currency is a virtual currency with no central regulatory or
issuing authority.



Some Common Security Issues:
 Pharming
• This takes place when the attacker redirects a user from an authentic and 
genuine site to a fake and deceitful site where their systems are infused 
with malware.

__________________________________________________________


Data Encryption Standard (DES):
• It was originally developed by IBM and was adopted as an NBS Standard 
in 1977.
• DESis a symmetric cryptosystem, so the cipher text is decrypted using 
the same key.
• It operates on 64-bit blocks of input at a time.
• DESuses a 56-bit encryption key, and it’s based on the Feistel Structure 
that was designed by a cryptographer named Horst Feistel.
• DESconverts 64-bit blocks of plaintext data into cipher text by dividing 
the block into two separate 32-bit blocks and applying the encryption 
process to each independently.

Steps of the DES encryption algorithm operating on 64-bit block are:
• Theprocess begins with the 64-bit plain text block getting handed over to an
initial permutation (IP) function.
• Theinitial permutation (IP) is then performed on the plain text.
• Next, the initial permutation (IP) creates two halves of the permuted block,
referred to as Left Plain Text (LPT) and Right Plain Text (RPT).
• Each LPTandRPTgoesthrough16 roundsof the encryption process.
• Finally, the LPT and RPT are rejoined, and a Final Permutation (FP) is
performed on the newly combined block.
• Theresult of this process produces the desired 64-bit ciphertext


 RSA Algorithm:
• The RSA algorithm is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm; this 
means that it uses a public key and a private key, a public key is 
shared publicly, while a private key is secret and must not be shared
with anyone.
• They all produced this algorithm, which is totally based on 
modular mathematics of Number theory. It is an asymmetric 
cryptography algorithm because it uses two different keys for 
encoding and decoding. 
• The RSA algorithm is named after those who invented it in 1978: 
Ron Rivest,Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman.

• Hybrid Encryption is the best of both symmetric and asymmetric encryption, symmetric 
encryption method is fast for large data encryption but falls short of identity 
verification. The asymmetric encryption method is quite opposite, it is slow but have 
public and private key pair which is a must when it comes to cyber safety.

• ADigital Signature is a technique by which it is possible to secure electronic 
information in such a way that the originator of the information, as well as 
the integrity of the information, can be verified.
• This procedure of guaranteeing the origin and the integrity of the 
information is also called Authentication.

• Electronic Signature: “Authentication of any electronic record 
by a subscriber by means of the electronic technique specified in 
the second schedule and includes digital signature.”
e.g. email signatures, web based signatures, digitized image of a 
signature.
• Electronic Signatures has no expiry or validity period unlike a 
digital signature which is valid up to a maximum of three years. 
Electronic Signatures are used for verifying a document unlike 
digital signatures which is used for securing a document.




 Authentication is the process of identifying users and validating who 
they claim to be.
• One of the most common and obvious factors to authenticate identity is 
a password. If the user name matches the password credential, it means
the identity is valid, and the system grants access to the user.

Authorization occurs after a user's identity has been successfully 
authenticated.
• It is about offering full or partial access rights to resources like 
database, funds, and other critical information to get the job done



 Someofthe popularhash functionsinclude:
• TheMessage Digest family comprises of hash functions MD2, MD4, MD5 and MD6.
It was adopted as Internet Standard RFC 1321. It is a 128-bit hash function.
• Secure Hash Functions family consists of four SHAalgorithms; SHA-0, SHA-1, 
SHA-2, and SHA-3.
• The RIPEMD is an acronymfor RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message 
Digest. This set of hash functions was devised by open research community and 
generally known as a family of European hash functions.
• Whirlpool is a 512-bit hash function which has stemmed from the revised edition of
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). One of the designer was Vincent Rijmen, a
co-creator of the AES.


A cryptographic protocol (protocol) is a distributed algorithm defined 
by a sequence of steps precisely specifying the actions required of
two or more entities to achieve a specific security objective.
• Protocols play a major role in cryptography and are
essential in meeting cryptographic goals.
• Encryption schemes, digital signatures, hash functions, and 
random number generation are among the primitives which may
be utilized to build a protocol

Key establishment is any process whereby a shared secret key 
becomes available to two or more parties, for subsequent 
cryptographic use.
 Key establishment can be broadly subdivided into
• key agreement
• key transport

 Keymanagementis the set of processes and mechanisms which 
support key establishment and the maintenance of ongoing keying
relationships between authorized parties, including replacing older
keys with new keys as and when necessary
• Key management encompasses techniques and procedures supporting:
• initialization of system users within a domain;
• generation, distribution, and installation of keying material;
• controlling the use of keying material;
• update, revocation, and destruction of keying material; and
• Storage, backup/recovery, and archival of keying material.



 Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG) refers to an algorithm that uses 
mathematical formulas to produce sequences of random numbers.

 Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG) refers to an algorithm that uses 
mathematical formulas to produce sequences of random numbers.
• For example, keys for encryption transformations need to be generated in a
manner which is unpredictable to an adversary.
• In cryptographic applications, one of the following steps must be 
performed:
• From a finite set of elements, select an element at random.
• From the set of all sequences (strings) of length over some finite alphabet 
of symbols, select a sequence at random.
• Generate a random sequence (string) of symbols of length over a set of  
symbols.



APKIstands for Public key Infrastructure in cryptography.
• The sole purpose of PKI is to facilitate the best secure electronic 
transfer of information for digital activities.
• PKI provides assurance of public key. It provides the identification of public
keys and their distribution.

 DES(Data Encryption Standard) is a encryption algorithm which uses
• symmetric keys for cipher encryption.
• It uses 56 bits (+8 parity bits) in 16 rounds having a block size of 64 bits.
• It has been designed by IBM team
• It was first published in 1975
• TRIPLE DESis a symmetric key-block cipher which applies DES cipher in 
triplicate. It encrypts with first key (K1), decrypts with second key (K2)
then decrypts with third key (K3). This is also a two-key variant where K1
and K3 are the same keys

Data management is the responsible stewardship of data throughout its lifecycle.
There are five components to data management:
• Acquisition
• Utilization
• Maintenance
• Access
• Protection
Effective data management requires appropriate acquisition, utilisation, maintenance, 
access, and protection of data.
Data management depends on information confidentiality and criticality.

Security Requirements (CIA)
The three governing principles are as follows:
• Confidentiality
• Confidentiality is the ability to hide information from those people unauthorized
to view it. It is the most obvious aspect of the CIAtriad. Cryptography and 
Encryption methods are an example of an attempt to ensure confidentiality of 
data transferred from one computer to another.
• Integrity
• The ability to ensure that data is an accurate and unchanged representation of the 
original secure information. One type of security attack is to intercept some
important data and make changes to it before sending it on to the intended
receiver
• Availability
• It means information should be 
consistently and readily 
accessible for authorized
parties.
• This involves properly 
managing hardware and 
technical infrastructure and
systems that hold and display the 
information




Security Threats and Attack:
Phishing
• Phishing attacks use fake communication, such as an email, to trick the
receiver into opening it and carrying out the instructions inside, such as
providing a credit card number.
• "The goal is to steal sensitive data like credit card and login information
or to install malware on the victim's machine," Cisco reports.

• Cyber-physical attacks
• The technology that has enabled to modernize and computerize critical
infrastructure also brings risk.
• There is an ongoing threat of hacks targeting electrical grids,
• transportation systems, etc., which represent a major vulnerability.

• Malware
• Malware is malicious software such as spyware, ransom ware,
• viruses and worms.
• Malware is activated when a user clicks on a malicious link or 
attachment, which leads to installing dangerous software.

• Maninthe middleattack
• Man in the Middle (MitM) attack occurs when cyber criminals place 
themselves between a two-party communication.
• Once the attacker interprets the communication, they may filter and
• steal sensitive data and return different responses to the user

• State-sponsored attacks
• Hackers look to make profit through stealing individual and corporate
• data.
• Cyber crime today is a major threat not only to the private sector and
• individuals but also towards the governments and nations as a whole.





 Anetwork is a group of connected computers that are able to send data
to each other.

• The Internet is a vast, sprawling collection of networks that connect to
each other.


 Asingle device that is assigned with an address when it connects to the
Internet known as the Internet protocol (IP) address and this address helps
in differentiating between devices in the network form all other devices.
• Almost every connection to be made with the Internet requires a device
which includes an address for sending/receiving messages in the form of
emails.
• Mobile phones too, operate within a network based on services that
are provided by service providers. They convert our voice into
electronic signals which are then transmitted through radio waves

Limitations are as below:
• Speed
• Accessibility
• Incompatibility
• Leakage of data
• Use of unsecured Wi-Fi
• SMishing



 Security management means minimizing the interruption of business
activities and reducing the vulnerability to various attacks.
• There are six principles of security management:
• Availability
• Integrity of data or systems
• Confidentiality of data or systems
• Accountability
• Assurance
• Privacy


• AnITsecurity audit is an overall assessment of the organization's.
• Athorough audit assesses the security of the system's physical
configuration and environment, software, information handling processes,
and user practices.
• Security audits give a reasonable and computable way to scrutinize
how secure a site really is.
• Thisassessment is designed to:
• Create a security benchmark for your organization;
• Identify the qualities and shortcomings of current security rehearses;
• Prioritize the exposures that present the most serious hazard;









 Regulation of the internet can increasingly rely on a three-fold strategy:
• Privatization:
• Propertization:
• Technological Controls the system is to be designed so as to hardware in
desired regulatory features.

diverse fields.


_______________________________


• Thecyber crimes are broadly classified into different groups:
• Crime against the individuals– Harassment, cyber-stalking,
deformation, indecent exposure, cheating, email spoofing, fraud, etc.
• Crimeagainst property– Transmitting virus, net-trespass, unauthorized 
control over computer system, internet thefts, infringement of intellectual 
property, etc.
• Crimeagainst organization– Cyber terrorism within government 
organization, possession of unauthorized information, distribution of pirate 
software, etc.
• Crime against society– Child pornography, financial crimes, sale of
unlawful articles, trafficking, forgery of records, gambling, etc.
• Cyber crimes are quite different from traditional crimes as they are often
harder to detect, investigate and prosecute and because of that cyber crimes
cause greater damage to society than traditional crimes.
• Cyber crime also includes traditional crimes conducted through the
internet or any other computer technology. For example; defamation,
forgery, identity theft, terrorism, cyber-stalking, hacking, software piracy,
web jacking and bullying are considered to be cyber crimes when
traditional crimes are committed through the use of a computer and the
internet.
• Section 43 to 45 of Information Technology Act, 2000 provides for the
instances where the wrong doer is liable to pay damages by way of
compensation to the effected party.
• Section 66 of Information Technology Act, 2000 however provides that if
any person, dishonestly or fraudulently, does any act referred to in
section 43, he or shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which
may extend to three years or with fine which may extend to five lakh
rupees or with both.



Following acts are considered as offences under the act:

Cyber forensic techniques include:
• Cross-driven analysis that correlates 
data from multiple hard drives.  
• Live analysis, which obtains data 
acquisitions before a PC is shut     
down. 
• Deleted file recovery.
• Detecting data theft using Stochastic 
Forensics.
• Concealing a file, message, image, or 
video within another file using  
Steganography

Computer forensic investigations go through five major standard 
digital forensic phases:
• Policy and procedure development, 
• Assessment,
• Acquisition, 
• Examination
• Reporting

Management of Intellectual Property Rights:
There are basically seven forms of intellectual property: copyright and 
related rights; trademarks, patent, industrial design, geographical 
indications, trade secrets and plant variety.
I.
Copyright and related rights
• Acopyright is used to protect creative literary, musical, dramatic, or other
artistic works like cinematographs films and sound recordings inclusive of
musical compositions, audio recordings, paintings, photos, sculptures,
books, articles, diagrams, movies, website content and even computer
software and programs though the inventions related to software are
protected under patent law.
II. Patents
• Apatent is an exclusive right granted to protect an invention which is a product
or a process and can also be applicable to newly engineered plant species or
strain however a discovery, scientific theory or mathematical method is
excluded from patentability, but its application or use can be patentable

 There are certain products or process which are Novel and have Industrial
application and are protected as Utility Model not as patent, for a shorter
period, generally 10 years and do not require inventive step as the
protection requirement like patents.

III. Trademarks
• A trademark is a distinctive sign, word, symbol or mark used in trade to 
distinguish the goods or services. Trademarks help consumers to identify
the source of products or services. It could be name, signature, logo, brand
label, phrase, slogan, letter, a numeral or any combination of them.
• For registration of trademark, it should be (i) distinctive in nature
(distinguishable from other goods and service). Registration of trade mark
is valid for specific period and needs to be renewed.

iv. Industrial designs Consists of appearance of a product/logo; the shape of
an object; composition of design, pattern of cloth. The industrial design
may have three-dimensional features, such as the shape or surface of an
article, or two-dimensional features, such as patterns, lines or color.

V. Geographical Indication (GI)
• It is a name or sign used on certain products which corresponds to a
specific geographical location or origin (e.g. a region, or country). A
Geographical Indication should have special quality or reputation.
• Geographical indications are typically used for agricultural products, food
stuffs,
wine and spirit drinks, handicrafts, and industrial products.
Examples: Basmati rice, Swiss watches, Ethiopian coffee, Tequila for
spirits produced in Mexico, Electrical appliance Made in UK.

VI. Trade Secrets
• A trade secret is any confidential secret information having inherent
economic advantage to company and is used in business that gives a
competitive edge by reason of it being secret. Examples include formulae,
practice, program, process, recipes, pattern, technique, compilation,
method, and device or product mechanism.

Linking, In-liningAnd Framing
 Linking" allows a Web site user to visit another location on the Internet. By
simply clicking on a "live" word or image in one Web page, the user can 
view another Web page elsewhere in the world, or simply elsewhere on the
same server as the original page.
• This technique is what gives the Web its unique communicative power. At the 
same time, however, linking may undermine the rights or interests of the 
owner of the page that is linked to. 
• Suppose, for example, that X sets up a homepage for her site. On the
homepage she places some advertisements, from which she hopes to make
some money. The homepage also contains links to various subordinate
pages, which contain content that X believes consumers would like to see.
• Y then creates his own Web site, which contains links to X's subordinate 
pages. The net result is that visitors to Y's site will be able to gain access 
to X's material, without ever seeing X's advertisements. This type of 
activity is called "deep linking.” (Intellectual Property in
Cyberspace(harvard.edu)).
• In-lining : "In-lining" is the process of displaying a graphic file on one 
website that originates at another. For example, in-lining occurs if a user at 
site A can, without leaving site A, view a "cartoon of the day" featured on
site B. IMG links-- a special type of link- can be used to display graphic
files on one site that are stored on another”.
(Playboy Enterprises v- NYU Law)

• Framing : "Framing" is the process of allowing a user to view the contents
of one website while it is framed by information from another site, similar
to the "picture-in-picture" feature offered on some televisions. Framing
may trigger a dispute under copyright and trademark law theories, because
a framed site arguably alters the appearance of the content and creates the
impression that its owner endorses or voluntarily chooses to associate with
the framer”. (Playboy Enterprises v- NYU Law).
• In Futuredontics Inc. v. Applied Anagramic Inc, 2007, A district court
ruled that the addition of the reproduced Web pages within a “frame” by
dental website containing contents of other website.



 The Copyright expires after 60 years from the end of the calendar year in
which the author dies Literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works;
• The Copyright shall subsist until 60 years from the beginning of the
calendar year following the year in which the film/sound recording/
photographs/ computer programs is made available or first published as the
case may be to the public.
• The act provides economic rights under sec 14 of act to commercially
exploit his creation and also grants moral rights as envisaged under
Section 57 of the Act which are special rights of the author of the work
viz.



Trade Marks Act (TMA), 1999 protects the rights of the trademark owners
or business entities for a term of 10 years from the date of application,
renewable every 10 years on payment of the requisite fee





Legal Protection in India
• Threetypes of remedies are available against infringement of IPR
• CivilRemedies- injunctions, damages, rendition of accounts, expert
order, seizure, destruction or forfeiture of infringing goods.
• Criminal remedies- section 63 of the Copyright Act, 1957 deals with 
Offences of infringement of copyright and Chapter XII of the Trademarks 
Act, 1999 deals with offences, penalties and procedures pertaining to
trademark infringement.
• Administrative Remedies- import/ export of goods including protection
of patents, trademarks and copyrights under Indian Customs Act, 1962.

• The geographical Indications of (Registration and Protection) Act, 
1999 for Laws relating to Geographical Indication; Information 
Technology Act, 2000 deals with electronic records



International scenario
• Important treaties which provide international protection to Copyright are:
• BerneConvention for protection of Literary and Artistic Works, 1886.
• Universal Copyright Convention, 1952.
• Agreement on Trade related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights,1994.
• The purpose of making these treaties is to create uniformity in dealing 
with the disputes related to the Intellectual Property Rights, because 
copyright is governed within the country according to the internal laws of 
the country and with the help of these treaties, uniform protection is given 
to all member countries of that particular treaty.
