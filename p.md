Creating an automated bot that takes a blog post link and converts it into video shorts in a language of your choice involves several components. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how you can build this from scratch:

üß† Overview of the Workflow
Input: Blog post URL
Processing:
Scrape and summarize the blog content
Translate (if needed)
Convert to script suitable for video
Output:
Generate visuals (images/video clips)
Add voiceover in chosen language
Compile into a short video
üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack Suggestions
Backend: Python (for automation and AI integration)
Frontend: Optional (for UI input)
Libraries/Tools:
BeautifulSoup / Newspaper3k ‚Äì for scraping blog content
OpenAI GPT / LangChain ‚Äì for summarization and script generation
Google Translate API / DeepL ‚Äì for translation
gTTS / Amazon Polly / Azure TTS ‚Äì for voiceover
MoviePy / FFmpeg ‚Äì for video creation
Stable Diffusion / DALL¬∑E ‚Äì for generating visuals
üß© Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. Scrape Blog Content



Python
from newspaper import Article

url = "https://example.com/blog-post"
article = Article(url)
article.download()
article.parse()
text = article.text

2. Summarize and Script
Use GPT or similar to summarize and convert to a short script:




Python
summary_prompt = f"Summarize this blog post into a short video script:\n{text}"
# Send to GPT API and get script

3. Translate Script (Optional)



Python
from googletrans import Translator

translator = Translator()
translated_script = translator.translate(script, dest='hi').text  # Hindi example

4. Generate Voiceover



Python
from gtts import gTTS

tts = gTTS(translated_script, lang='hi')
tts.save("voiceover.mp3")

5. Create Visuals
Use AI-generated images or stock footage:

Use keywords from the script to generate images via DALL¬∑E or Stable Diffusion
Or use royalty-free clips from Pexels/Unsplash
6. Compile Video



Python
from moviepy.editor import *

audio = AudioFileClip("voiceover.mp3")
image = ImageClip("image.jpg").set_duration(audio.duration)
video = image.set_audio(audio)
video.write_videofile("short_video.mp4", fps=24)

üåç Language Support
You can support multiple languages by:

Translating the script
Using multilingual TTS engines (Amazon Polly, Azure TTS support many languages)

Great! Here's a complete guide to building an automated bot that takes a blog post link and generates video shorts in any language, using only free tools and resources ‚Äî with zero investment.

üß† High-Level Workflow
Input: Blog post URL
Scrape: Extract blog content
Summarize: Convert to short script
Translate: Into desired language
Voiceover: Generate audio
Visuals: Create or fetch images
Video: Combine audio + visuals
üõ†Ô∏è Free Tools You Can Use
Task	Free Tool	Notes
Scraping	Newspaper3k	Python library for extracting blog content
Summarizing	OpenAI GPT (free tier) or HuggingFace Transformers	Use free models like t5-small
Translation	Google Translate API (free tier)	Up to 500K characters/month
Voiceover	gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)	Free and supports many languages
Visuals	Unsplash API or DALL¬∑E mini	Free stock images or AI-generated
Video Editing	MoviePy	Python library for video creation
üß© Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Scrape Blog Content



Python
from newspaper import Article

url = "https://example.com/blog-post"
article = Article(url)
article.download()
article.parse()
text = article.text

2. Summarize the Content
Use HuggingFace's t5-small model:




Python
from transformers import pipeline

summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="t5-small")
summary = summarizer(text[:1000])  # Limit input size
script = summary[0]['summary_text']

3. Translate the Script



Python
from googletrans import Translator

translator = Translator()
translated_script = translator.translate(script, dest='hi').text  # Hindi example

4. Generate Voiceover



Python
from gtts import gTTS

tts = gTTS(translated_script, lang='hi')
tts.save("voiceover.mp3")

5. Fetch or Generate Visuals
Use keywords from the script to search Unsplash:




Python
import requests

query = "technology"
response = requests.get(f"https://source.unsplash.com/800x600/?{query}")
with open("image.jpg", "wb") as f:
    f.write(response.content)

6. Create Video



Python
from moviepy.editor import *

audio = AudioFileClip("voiceover.mp3")
image = ImageClip("image.jpg").set_duration(audio.duration)
video = image.set_audio(audio)
video.write_videofile("short_video.mp4", fps=24)

üöÄ How to Automate It
You can wrap all this into a Python script or Flask app:

Accept blog URL and language as input
Run the pipeline
Output a downloadable video file
üß™ Optional Enhancements
Use LangChain for chaining tasks
Add subtitles using moviepy.TextClip
Host on Replit or Render for free deployment
Would you like me to generate a ready-to-run Python script for this entire pipeline? Or help you deploy it as a simple web app?
