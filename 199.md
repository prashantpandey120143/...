UNIT 2: SECURITY BREACHES IN CYBERSPACE

*   **Cyberspace Definition:** The virtual computer world; an electronic medium using a large worldwide network that often employs the **TCP/IP protocol** to facilitate online communication and data exchange.

1.  **Unauthorized Access:** Gaining access to a computer, network, system, or device without permission from authorized persons.
2.  **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack:** When multiple systems attempt to overwhelm a service (servers, applications, networks) with malicious data or requests, making it impossible for the service to be delivered to legitimate users.
3.  **Malware (Malicious Software):** Any program or file harmful to a computer user, including viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, and spyware. Malware can steal, encrypt, or delete sensitive data, hijack computing functions, or monitor user activity.
4.  **Social Engineering:** Psychological manipulation, fooling unsuspecting users or employees into revealing confidential or sensitive data, often involving communication that invokes urgency or fear.
5.  **Phishing:** Attacks attempting to gain sensitive information (usernames, passwords, credit card information, network credentials) via fake communication (typically email) to steal data or install malware.
6.  **Crypto Jacking:** Cybercrime involving the unauthorized use of a person's devices (computers, tablets, or servers) by criminals to mine **cryptocurrency**.
7.  **Pharming:** Occurs when an attacker redirects a user from an authentic site to a fake site where the user's system is injected with malware.
8.  **Cyber-Physical Attacks:** Cyber attacks breaching security and impacting the physical environment, potentially including devices like cameras or lights, or critical infrastructure like electrical grids and transportation systems.

    *   **Type:** Symmetric cryptosystem (decrypted using the same key).
    *   **Origin:** Developed by IBM and adopted as an NBS Standard in 1977.
    *   **Parameters:** Uses a **56-bit encryption key** (plus 8 parity bits) and operates on **64-bit blocks** of input data.
    *   **Structure:** Based on the Feistel Structure and uses **16 rounds** of encryption.
    *   **Process:** The 64-bit plaintext undergoes an Initial Permutation (IP), is split into Left Plain Text (LPT) and Right Plain Text (RPT), goes through 16 rounds, is rejoined, and undergoes a Final Permutation (FP) to produce the 64-bit ciphertext.
    *   **Triple DES (3DES):** Applies the DES cipher three times, typically encrypting with K1, decrypting with K2, and then encrypting with K3.

2.  **RSA Algorithm:**
    *   **Type:** Asymmetric cryptography algorithm (uses two different keys for encoding/decoding).
    *   **Origin:** Invented in 1978 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman.
    *   **Basis:** Totally based on modular mathematics of Number theory.
    *   **Keys:** Uses a **public key** (shared publicly) and a **private key** (kept secret).
    *   **Formulas:** Encryption: $C = P^e \text{ mod } n$; Decryption: $P = C^d \text{ mod } n$.

3.  **Hybrid Encryption:** Combines the speed of symmetric encryption (good for large data) with the identity verification provided by asymmetric encryption (public/private key pairs), combining the best attributes of both.

4.  **Digital Signatures vs. Electronic Signatures:**
    *   **Digital Signature:** A technique used to secure electronic information by verifying its originator and integrity (Authentication). It follows a hash function approach using a private and public key pair. It is valid up to a maximum of **three years** and is used for securing documents (e.g., e-filing, tenders).

    *   **Key Management:** The set of processes supporting key establishment and maintenance (e.g., generation, distribution, updating, destruction, storage/backup).
    *   **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI):** Infrastructure designed to facilitate the secure electronic transfer of information by assuring, identifying, and distributing public keys.
    *   **PKI Components:** Public Key Certificate (digital certificate), Private Key tokens, Certification Authority (CA), Registration Authority, and Certificate Management System.
    *   **PKI Disadvantage:** The public key is in the public domain and vulnerable to misuse, leading to security compromise often due to poor key management.
    *   **Trusted Third Party (TTP):** An entity trusted to perform a specific service in a domain; a TTP is **"functionally trusted"** if they are assumed honest but do not have access to users' secret or private keys.
